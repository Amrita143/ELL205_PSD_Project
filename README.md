# ELL205_PSD_Project
Power Spectral Density (ELL205 Project under Prof.S.D.Joshi) (Oct,2022 - Nov,2022):
Computed power spectral density of diferent power signals using Fast-Fourier-Transform and autocorrelation
function and wrote a python program to remove/flter noise from diferent noisy sound signals using PSD.
